## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

For this project we have chosen a dataset the pertains to medical expenses throughout the life of an individual. The dataset includes a number of variables for each individual, and our goal is to identify correlations between them. These variables include age, sex, body mass index, whether or not they smoke, the region they come from, and medical expenses. It will be very interesting to determine which variables have the greatest impact on, or the highest correlation with, medical expenses. This will give us an insight into how the choices an individual makes, and the circumstances they find themselves in, affect their medical history. Additionally, we hope to find a number of other correlations between each of the variables, and ideally be able to hypothesize how they are related. All in all, we will work to establish many correlations from this dataset with the main focus of formulating a conclusion concerning which variables are the best predictors for high medical charges throughout oneâ€™s life. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
This dataset is a simulated data set based off of the United States census which shows how certain variables affect the lifetime medical expenses of an individual. The dataset contains a variety of variables such as age, sex, body mass index, number of children, whether they are a smoker or not, region they come from and finally medical charges. This data set includes 1338 individuals, and outlines the previously mentioned variables for all of them. This translates to a total of 9366 data points for us to manipulate and explore. These data points come in a few different forms. These include numbers, strings, and Booleans. This will give us the experience of handling a number of different data types, and we will be able to better apply our learnings from class. This dataset was constructed by Brett Lantz using R for his book on machine learning which was published in October 2013.
